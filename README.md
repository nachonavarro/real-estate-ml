# real-estate-ml
Using geospatial data to find investment opportunities in the real estate market

# Tasks

  1. Clean the dataset we already have. We need to decide what columns to keep and what columns to discard, what rows to filter (some properties are listed with a sale price of 1 dollar, we need to get rid of stuff like that).
  2. * Determine which geographical features we're going to include (proximity to a river, number of coffee places, supermarkets, etc)
     * We need to merge that dataset with another one we create that gives geographical features about the place. I'm assuming the way to go here is to call the Google Maps API, but we can research more alternatives.
